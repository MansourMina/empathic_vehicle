# CARLA Auto Start Setup Guide

This project provides a ready-to-use script that automatically starts the CARLA simulator (v0.9.15), installs dependencies, and launches traffic and control scripts. It is designed for **Windows users** with minimal technical background.

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Python 3.7

1. Download Python 3.7 from the official archive:  
    https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.9/python-3.7.9-amd64.exe

2. Run the installer:
   - Make sure to check the box that says: **“Add Python to PATH”**
   - Then choose **Customize installation** > Leave all defaults checked

3. After installation, rename the Python executable to `python37.exe`:
   - Go to: `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37`
   - Find `python.exe`, and rename it to `python37.exe`

> This step is important to make sure our scripts run consistently.

### Step 2: Clone This Project

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **Git Bash**
2. Run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MansourMina/empathic_vehicle.git
cd empathic_vehicle
```

### Step 3: Download and Extract CARLA 0.9.15

1. Go to:  
    https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.15

2. Download the **Windows binary** (e.g., `CARLA_0.9.15.zip`)

3. Extract the zip contents **into the `empathic_vehicle/` folder**

---

### Step 4: Run the Simulator

Double-click:

```
run_all.bat
```

This script will:

- Copy your custom config and script files over CARLA’s defaults
- Wait for CARLA to fully launch
- Install Python requirements
- Run traffic generation and manual control

## PowerShell Script Blocking

If Windows blocks PowerShell scripts from running, run this command **once** in PowerShell:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

-  Don't extract CARLA into the root folder — always into the `carla/` subfolder
-  Don't pull this repo into a downloaded CARLA folder
-  Clone the repo first, then extract CARLA
